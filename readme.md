The file resurrectionbug.py uses the library PySimpleGUI (included) to produce a virtual bug that has 3 states, well, ill and dead. However for the reserrection bug, dead is less than permanent and it continues to age during throughout. It health varies consitently with state. 

The program uses the column element from PySimpleGUI to change the contents of the window and a function is used to update this column and ensure only one column is used at a time.
This technique lets us, fairly easily, plan software in which the user sees only one window at a time ... this covers many situations.  We will use this to put a GUI front end on our database ... eventually.

But first: Can you adapt the program to make a story board App, in which a story is told using a pixel cartoon.  You should try to extend it by incorporating some of the other elements from PySimpleGUI.
